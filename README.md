Welcome,
To use and to show my results, you have to digit on your shell the commands
# cd Ciaramella
# chmod u+x ex.pro
# chmod u+x ex.pro.py
# source ex_pro
The programm ex_pro downloads the file 'Nemo_6670.dat'. Now digit on your shell
# program
The program now asks to you to select the file that you want to analyzed (yes, it could be a little repetitive), when you select the correct file it asks to you to rename the file (if you want to),
and if the new name is different, the program ex_pro.py starts and copies the file with the new name. After that the the programm ex_pro.py analyzes and produces 4 images that satisfy the quests.
